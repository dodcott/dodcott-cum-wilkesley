I have moved the web site so that it is now hosted on Github.com. I have also
changed the site generator from Pelican to Nikola.

I'll put up another post later to explain why I have made these
changes. Meanwhile you may notice a few minor glitches in this site, while I iron out
all the little bugs caused by the changes.
