St Mary's and St Michael's in Burleydam. This commemorates the members
of the parish who were killed in the conflict. The memorial was
erected in 1920 and is made from sandstone. In recent years the
engravings of the names of the fallen have started to become
indistinct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been lucky to obtain donations from Burleydam Village Hall
Trust, Combermere Abbey and a Communities Grant from Cheshire
East to re-cut the names.  The work will be completed in the next few
months, so the names should be preserved for many more years.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="[WW1]"></category></entry><entry><title>Parish Council Meeting Monday, September 8th 2014.</title><link href="http://geekinthesticks.github.io/dodcott-cum-wilkesley/posts/2014/Sep/01/parish-council-meeting-monday-september-8th-2014/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-09-01T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Ian Barton.</name></author><id>tag:geekinthesticks.github.io,2014-09-01:dodcott-cum-wilkesley/posts/2014/Sep/01/parish-council-meeting-monday-september-8th-2014/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is a Parish Council meeting on Monday 8th February at Burleydam
